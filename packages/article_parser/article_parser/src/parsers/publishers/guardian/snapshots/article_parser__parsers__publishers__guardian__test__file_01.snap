            body: "WH Smith has become the latest company to issue a profit warning because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a major drop in shoppers at its airport outlets.\nThe retailer’s shares dropped 15% to £13.39 as it warned that the virus outbreak would cost it up to £130m in lost revenues. It said annual profits were likely to be £30m-£40m lower than previously expected. This in effect halves its profit forecast of nearly £80m.\nSome analysts warned the impact could be even worse, after the US president banned most travel from the E U to the country for 30 days. The restrictions will not apply to US citizens or travellers from the UK.\nThe books and stationery store chain flagged a “significant impact” on its shops at airports in the Asia Pacific region, which account for 5% of its travel division’s revenues.\nIn the past fortnight, passenger numbers have dropped significantly at UK airports, where its shops represent 60% of travel revenues; in the US, which accounts for a quarter of travel revenues; and in Europe. WH Smith expects revenues at its UK airport shops to fall by 35% in March and April.\nThe pandemic could also affect high street spending in the UK, the retailer said, and would drag down its full-year revenues and profits.\nNeil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets.com, said: “You have to feel a little sorry for a company that has done a brilliant job of pivoting away from the struggling British high street to driving all its revenue and profit growth from airports and train stations.\n“A rapid decline in footfall at travel sites because of coronavirus is hitting revenues and will result in a material decline in profits this year. Trump’s 30-day European travel ban makes things worse and threatens to make today’s estimates only partially reflective of the level of damage that could be done this year.”\nIn the six months to 29 February, WH Smith posted a 1% drop in like-for-like revenues. Travel revenues were up 2%, while high street income fell 4%.\nLast May it was rated the UK’s worst high street retailer by consumers for the second year in a row in a Which? survey. Shoppers accused it of having “untidy stores” and offering “poor value for money”.",
